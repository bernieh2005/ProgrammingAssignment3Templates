ProgrammingAssignment3Templates
===============================

This is a repository for my Programming Assignment 3 TEMPLATES (no solutions given or hinted). These correspond to the R Programming Data course from Coursera. 

I added comments and output examples to each template; the texts are EXACTLY copied from the instructions provided for this assignment. 

So, you may consider these as "batteries included" templates.
